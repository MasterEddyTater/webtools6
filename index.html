          I was born on May 9th, 2005, in Irving, Texas. I’ve lived there for
          most of my life, and it’s where I grew up and where many of my
          interests began to develop. One of my biggest hobbies is playing video
          games, especially turn-based games and CRPGs (computer role-playing
          games). I love how they combine deep stories, strategy, and
          world-building. What I enjoy most is making choices that shape the
          game’s world. Outside of gaming, I’m really interested in mythology.
          I’ve always been drawn to myths from different cultures, especially
          Greek and Japanese. I enjoy the stories, the symbolism, and what they
          reveal about the people who created them. My favorite mythological
          creature is the Manticore from Persian mythology. It's a mix of a
          lion’s body, a human face, and a spiked tail (sometimes with dragon
          wings). History is another major passion of mine. I’m curious about
          how the world became what it is today, and I love learning about
          different civilizations. Whether they're from Africa, Asia, Europe, or
          the Americas, I’m interested in how people lived, what they believed,
          and how their societies worked. Overall, I’m someone who values
          learning and creativity. Whether through games, myths, or history, I
          love exploring different worlds, real or imagined, and understanding
          what makes them unique. These interests continue to shape how I see
          the world and what I want to learn moving forward.

        <a href="images/Magos_Dominus_Faustinius.jpg">
          <img style="float: left;" src="images/Magos_Dominus_Faustinius.jpg" alt="This is Magos Dominus Faustinius from the game Warhammer 40k: Mechanicus!" title="This is Magos Dominus Faustinius from the game: Warhammer 40k: Mechanicus, the character my avatar comes from.">
        </a>
        <p>
          I chose this image as my avatar for a few reasons. At first, I
          considered just using a regular photo of myself, but it felt too
          boring. I wanted something that showed more personality and
          creativity. This image does that. If you hover over it, you’ll see who
          the character is, but fans of Warhammer 40k might recognize it
          instantly. The avatar is from the Adeptus Mechanicus, a faction in
          Warhammer 40k obsessed with machines, technology, and the worship of
          knowledge. I’ve been playing a game that features them heavily, and
          their aesthetic really intrigued me. They treat technology almost like
          a religion, which I found both unique and thought-provoking. Other
          than just looking cool, this image weirdly relates to the career path
          I've chosen. I’m currently studying for a Web Developer AAS degree,
          learning to build websites and digital tools. I spend a lot of time
          thinking about how technology works and how to use it creatively. In a
          strange way, I see a connection between my interests and the Adeptus
          Mechanicus, both focused on machines, logic, and innovation. This
          avatar shows my love for gaming and tabletop lore, but it also hints
          at my deeper interests in tech and design. It’s an interesting and
          subtle way to express both my hobbies and my goals.

        <p>
          I’m currently enrolled in a Web Developer AAS (Associate of Applied
          Science) degree program, where I’m learning how to build functional,
          user-friendly websites. The coursework covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          Linux configuration, Python, and back-end development. I’ve always
          been interested in technology, especially how websites and apps work
          behind the scenes. For a long time, I wanted to learn to code, but the
          amount of information online was overwhelming. With so many languages,
          tools, and paths to choose from, I struggled to focus and figure out
          where to start. That’s why I decided to pursue a formal education. I
          needed structure and guidance, and this program gives me exactly that.
          Starting from the basics and working up to more advanced topics has
          helped me build confidence and stay motivated. While I’m not sure
          exactly where I’ll end up after graduation, I know I want to work in
          web development. Whether it’s building sites for clients, working for
          a company, or freelancing, I’m open to opportunities that help me grow
          and apply what I’ve learned. Most importantly, I feel like I’m finally
          on the right path, doing something I enjoy that also has real-world
          value. Web development is always evolving, and that constant learning
          is what makes it exciting.
